Financial institutions often use credit risk classification models to identify the risk of borrowers, to make informed business decisions. However, such data sets are often highly unbalanced, which can cause a highly biased effect  on the classification performance of predictive algorithms. This is because traditional machine learning models and evaluation metrics assume a balanced data distribution. There had been many proposed techniques in dealing with classification of unbalanced datasets, one of which is adopting resampling techniques to artificially rebalance binary classification datasets commonly faced in real world problems. In this paper, we present a study on the performance of using the various methods of resampling using various predictive modelling algorithms, to identify which combination performs the best. We observed that SMOTE + Boosted Tree Predictive Algorithm produces the best results. Additionally, the parameters of Boosted Tree were tuned to further improve the model.
